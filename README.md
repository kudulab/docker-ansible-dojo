# docker-ansible-dojo

This is a docker [dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo) image to be used by administrator operating with ansible.
In ansible terms, this provides the controller environment.

## Specification

 * Ansible `2.8` is installed from git source. So it is easy to fork and patch.
 * docker CLI for ansible docker connector to work
 * bats for minimal testing support

## Usage
1. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/), if you haven't already.
2. Install [Dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo#installation) it is a self-contained binary, so just place it somewhere on the `PATH`.
On **Linux**:
```bash
DOJO_VERSION=0.5.0
wget -O dojo https://github.com/kudulab/dojo/releases/download/${DOJO_VERSION}/dojo_linux_amd64
sudo mv dojo /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dojo
```
3. Provide a Dojofile:
```
DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE="kudulab/ansible-dojo:1.0.0"
```
4. Create and enter the container by running `dojo` at the root of project.
5. Work with ansible as usual:
```bash
ansible-playbook ansible/site.yml -i inventory/myinv.yml --tags web
ansible-doc file
ansible all -m ping -i inventory/myinv.yml
ansible-lint -x idempotency playbook.yml
yamllint .
```

By default, current directory in docker container is `/dojo/work`.

### Docker daemon inside the ansible-dojo container
In order to have docker daemon running in the ansible-dojo container, you need
 to add to Dojofile:
```
DOJO_DOCKER_OPTIONS="--privileged -v /some/local/dir:/var/lib/docker"
```

And then start the docker daemon inside the ansible-dojo container with:
```
sudo service docker start
```
